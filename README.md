This is an application that provided a practical application of some current software knowledge.  The purpose of the app is to provide Biblical text without having distractions of annotated notes, verse numbers, etc. The application utilizes a variety of web technologies including node.js on the express framework, backbone.js, twitter's bootstrap and require.js.  

The application utilizes a proxy server, ran by node, to make api calls to a seperate API that already exists.  This returns the information as JSON objects which are then parsed as needed.  

There is still a lot of left to do and I hope to continue development as I have time! :)
